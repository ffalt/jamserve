1.12.0 or earlier, authentication is performed by sending the password as clear text or hex-encoded. Examples:\n\nhttp://your-server/rest/ping.view?u=joe&p=sesame&v=1.12.0&c=myapp\nhttp://your-server/rest/ping.view?u=joe&p=enc:736573616d65&v=1.12.0&c=myapp\n\nStarting with API version 1.13.0, the recommended authentication scheme is to send an authentication token, calculated as a one-way salted hash of the password.\n\nThis involves two steps:\n\n    For each REST call, generate a random string called the salt. Send this as parameter s.\n    Use a salt length of at least six characters.\n    Calculate the authentication token as follows: token = md5(password + salt). The md5() function takes a string and returns the 32-byte ASCII hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash, using lower case characters for the hex values. The '+' operator represents concatenation of the two strings. Treat the strings as UTF-8 encoded when calculating the hash. Send the result as parameter t.\n\nFor example: if the password is sesame and the random salt is c19b2d, then token = md5(\"sesamec19b2d\") = 26719a1196d2a940705a59634eb18eab.
